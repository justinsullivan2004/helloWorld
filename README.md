# Overview

This program marks the start of my 12 week journey for 6 different projects in languages I am not familiar with. This helloWorld program isn't mean to be special but instead be the starting point of this journey. 

The program is simply meant to say hello world when you run the program. 

My purpose is to create a workspace for me future projects.
